Shoutout to Caleb and Gerard for the JS Panopto videos  

the insiration behind this game is my passion for football. i have loved the game of football ever since i was a kid 
This is a very simple game of NFL trivia.
this game is unfinished and unlplayable at the time.

if I had more time I wouldve added a timer per question
